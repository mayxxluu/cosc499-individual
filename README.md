# COSC 499 - Individual Github Exercise
Welcome to my first Github repository for COSC 499 Capstone Software Engineering! The purpose of this repo is to get myself familiar with again with using Git and practicing push/pull requests, commits, etc.

For this exercise, I will create a very simple Java program that takes a user's input (either integers or strings), sorts it, and returns the sorted input back to the user.
